Changed the way the output is generated.  In the example below i have an unordered list with ids on the <li>s.

HTML
<div id="timer">
     <ul>
           <li id="days"></li>
           <li id="hours"></li>
           <li id="minutes"></li>
           <li id="seconds"></li>
     </ul>
</div>

CSS
#timer ul { list-style-type: none; }
#timer ul li span { display: block; float: left; width: 100px; }

This is a simple javascript countdown timer for jquery.  You put this in your scripts.js file.  This is not a plugin.  Currently it works by pulling unix time off an id of a span in your html.  My original purpose was for pulling the initial timer from a db.  I would like to adapt this into a jquery plugin so that you could call it like this:

$("#timer").countDown("September 01, 2011 00:00:00");
